RoboMK, a Vision-Based Robot Hand Mimicker


About
The following document is a guide to allow users to expedite their progress in being able to use the WLKATA Mirobot. There is also an example script in the demonstration section which can be used to explore the Mirobot functionality or develop more advanced functions.


Requirements 
The following software and libraries should be downloaded and installed to be able to develop scripts for the Mirobot:
-Python(https://www.python.org/)
-WLkata Mirobot library(https://document.wlkata.com/?doc=/wlkata-mirobot-resources-for-education/python-sdk/)
-OpenCV
-Mediapipe 
-CVzone


Installation
To install PyCharm , Python, Mediapipe, OpenCV, cvzone and Mirobot library, the installation section in this video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs&ab_channel=Murtaza%27sWorkshop-RoboticsandAI (4:37) can be used as a guide. Though only OpenCV library is shown being installed, the remainder libraries can also be installed using this table with specified versions used in the script in the next section. The video mentioned above is also very useful in understanding the application of OpenCV in the script attached in the execution section.
