# RoboMK
RoboMK, a Vision-Based Robot Hand Mimicker

A draft script to be used for reference for anyone interested in using the WLKATA Mirobot for gesture mimicking. 

Requirements <br />
The following software and libraries should be downloaded and installed to be able to develop scripts for the Mirobot:<br />
-Python(https://www.python.org/)<br />
-WLkata Mirobot library(https://document.wlkata.com/?doc=/wlkata-mirobot-resources-for-education/python-sdk/)<br />
-OpenCV<br />
-Mediapipe <br />
-CVzone<br />


Installation<br />
To install PyCharm , Python, Mediapipe, OpenCV, cvzone and Mirobot library, the installation section in this video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs&ab_channel=Murtaza%27sWorkshop-RoboticsandAI (4:37) can be used as a guide. Though only OpenCV library is shown being installed, the remainder libraries can also be installed using this table with specified versions used in the script. The video mentioned above is also very useful in understanding the application of OpenCV in the script attached in the execution section.
